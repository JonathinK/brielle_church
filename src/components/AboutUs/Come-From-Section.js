        <Body>The Church In  Brielle, a Spiritual Wellness for Mind, Body, and Soul, was established in 1957 by The Reformed Church in America, the oldest denomination in North America. Perhaps you know a bit about us but, if not, we are a lot like the Presbyterian Church and are a part of the holy Catholic Church  â€”  Catholic meaning global.</Body>
